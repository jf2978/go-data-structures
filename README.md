# Go Data Structures

I've used the Go programming language for some time now and it's really grown on me as my language of choice. The only issue I have with it though, is my disconnected knowledge I have between my academic, coding-interview comfort (that I usually lean on Java for unfortunately) and my profressional experience with it writing gRPC services with protobuf / GCP.

So this repo is just trying to fill in those gaps by relearning some good ol' Computer Science Fundamentals using Go.
